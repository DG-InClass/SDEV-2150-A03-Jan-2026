# Agenda (SDEV-2150 | A03)

We meet on **Wednesdays** and **Fridays**

> These are my notes on what I plan to teach in each [**upcoming class**](#dec-01). Also check out the [**Draft Planning Calendar**](./Calendar.md).
>
> ###### *... Warn those who are idle ..., encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone.*
>
> > My philosophy of teaching, taken from [the source](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/1TH.5.14.NIV)

> ## Starter Kits
>
> I provide a number of starter kits through the term, which you can grab using the process described below.
>
> 📖 These starter kits often have lots of `ReadMe.md` files. That means I want you to **read** that information. 👀
>
> To grab a starting point for any in-class demos or practices, you can use [**tiged**](https://github.com/tiged/tiged) (based on [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) by Rich Harris, creator of Svelte). It will allow you to grab a copy of the starter kit folder to put into your student workbook.
> 
> You will need to have `pnpm` installed and working on your computer. Run the following code in the terminal from the **root** of your repository:
>
> ```bash
> pnpm dlx tiged --disable-cache --force dgilleland/CPSC-1520-Workbook/sk/-how-to- ./src/-how-to-
> ```
>
> ***Note:** You may need to <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> to stop the `pnpm tlx tiged` command after it has finished downloading the demo folder.*
