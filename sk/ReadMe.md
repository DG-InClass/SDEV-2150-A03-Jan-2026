# Starter Kits

All the starter kits are mapped directly to the classroom lessons for each day. They are "sized" to fit neatly within a single classroom delivery period (about 2 hours).

Lessons are generally accompanied with homework assignments. The homework assignments are geared to reinforcing the material in the related lesson.
