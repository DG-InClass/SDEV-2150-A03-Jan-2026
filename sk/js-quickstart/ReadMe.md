# JavaScript Quickstart

Are you looking to reinforce your JavaScript fundamentals from the ground up? Then a great place to start is to do the following set of JavaScript Quickstart tutorials! These focus on JavaScript by itself - no HTML or CSS to muddy the waters.

## Running JavaScript with `node --watch`

You can explore JavaScript without any other web files (HTML/CSS) or even a web server! This is possible by using NodeJS.

To run a single JavaScript file in your workbook using Node, do the following:


1. Open a new terminal in VS Code.
2. Change to this directory: `cd src/js-quickstart`
3. Run your script in watch mode. For example, if you have a file named `sandbox.js`, you can run it by entering `node --watch sandbox.js`.
4. Now, you can position your terminal and your JavaScript file side-by side and watch what happens as you edit and save your code!


## Debugging

You can also open a JavaScript Debug Terminal and use breakpoints along with VS Code's built-in debugging tools. It's the same steps as above, but you begin with selecting **`JavaScript Debug Terminal`** from the terminal's drop-down.

To put a breakpoint on a line of code, simply click on the left of any line number of your code (this area is called the gutter) to toggle breakpoints on and off.
